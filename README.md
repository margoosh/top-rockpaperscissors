# top-rockpaperscissors
## Description 
### Initial Project Focus
For this project, I created a Rock Paper Scissors game that is played entirely in the console. The focus of this exercise is to develop a fundamental understanding of JavaScript basics and improve my coding practices without the use of a graphical user interface (GUI). This means I will be directly working with the logic behind the game, rather than visual elements like buttons or text fields. My focus was to: 

    1. Plan or pseudocode my solutions
    2. Write code based off pseudocode
    3. Test managable blocks of code to ensure it works 

The importance of this approach lies in honing core problem-solving skills, which are foundational to software development. By breaking the project down into smaller steps—starting with planning or pseudocoding, writing the code, and thoroughly testing-I have ensured that I not only developed a functioning game but I am also building a strong problem-solving mindset that will help me throughout the rest of my programming journey. Furthermore, developing the habit of committing code to GitHub helps maintain version control, which is essential for managing projects and tracking progress over time.
